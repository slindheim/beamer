  abstract  = "Summary1.The genetic consequences of selection of intermediates
               or extremes for metric characters has been analysed- Selection
               of intermediates leads to fixation and selection of extremes
               (disassortative mating) will lead to a stable genetic situation
               with intermediate gene frequencies. 2.The selection of
               intermediates is similar to the higher natural fitness of metric
               . intermediates often found in nature. The alternative model for
               the latter situation, in which the extremes hare a low fitness
               because they are homozygotes, was also analysed. It was found
               that several different phenomena could be interrelated on this
               model---the relationship of fitness to deviation both in the
               equilibrium population and after artificial selection, the
               decline in fitness after such selection and the rate of return
               to the equilibrium position when selection was suspended. The
               constant integrating these, called the homo-eostatic strength of
               the character, is related to the mean fitness of homozygotes
               compared to that of heterozygotes at the individual loci
