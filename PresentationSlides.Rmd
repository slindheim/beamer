# This is a slide title

* Content

## subsection

* More content

# Slide with code

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x = 3
y = 2
print(x**y)
```

# Slide with code used to generate output

```{r, echo=F}
x = 4
y = 3
```

`r x` raised to the power of `r y` equals `r x**y`.

# Slide with Python code

```{python, echo=TRUE}
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(10)
print(x)
```


# Slide with an image

The caption for this image is generated from another `R` variable.
It is easier to do it this way sometimes.

```{r, echo=F}
caption="Gaussian stabilizing selection"
```

```{r model1, echo=F, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=caption}
knitr::include_graphics("Model.png")
```

# Two-column slide and cross-references

:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

```{r, echo=F}
caption='Same as Figure \\ref{fig:model1}'
```

```{r model2, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap=caption}
knitr::include_graphics("Model.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
\ 
<!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
a column separator -->
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

Figures \ref{fig:model1} and \ref{fig:model2} are the same.

Comments:

* You need to manually write `Figure` or `Table`.
* You need to escape backslashes when doing references in a caption.

# Slide with R graphics

```{r, echo=F}
caption="R base graphics"
```

```{r rgraphics, echo=F, out.width="50%", fig.cap=caption}
plot(seq(1:1:10), seq(1:1:10))
```

# Slide with Python graphics

For some reason, you need to provide the caption as part of the code fence when generating Python graphics.

```{python pygraphics, echo=F, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Graphics with matplotlib"}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, x)
```

# Slide with fancy tables

Warning: `knitr::kable` can be a bit frustrating.
You can have conflicts with your preamble.

```{r kabletable, echo=F}
dt <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
knitr::kable(dt, format="latex", caption="Table caption.") %>%
    kable_styling(position="center")
```

# Citation

Having a blank slide at the end with the title "References" will put the detailed bibliography at the end.
